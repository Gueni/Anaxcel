# Anaxcel_PyQt5

A Python-based, open source, desktop application to import, read and analyse excel files in order to create and display multiple charts.

Anaxcel is Free Software under a GPLv2 license.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites


To be able to run this Program make sure you have the necessary packages installed on your machine:

####PyQt5:

Mainly use the following command under the cmd
```
pip install PyQt5
```
If that did not work, you might try this link from SourceForge [PyQt5 .exe installers for Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt5/).

install OpenPYXL in Python:

```
pip install openpyxl
```
If you need to include images into an openpyxl file, you will also need the “pillow” library that can be installed with:

```
pip install pillow
```

## Running 

Simply run the main script <anaxcel.py>.

```
python anaxcel.py
```

First start by loading a couple of excel files to the application. You can choose to load a display a single file or select multiple files.

Select what columns you wish to be the axis of the chart then hit analyse.The program will set focus on the newly generated Pareto Chart.

As a bonus we wanted to include multiple charts such the Donut chart. Unfortunatly , this is still a work in progress.
